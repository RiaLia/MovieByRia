## How to run
The steps I did to run the project locally: 

1. Open project in Android studio
2. Start up an emulator. 
3. Navigate to the project folder using powershell. And run:
4. npx react-native start
5. Create a new powershell window and run: 
6. npx react-native run-android




##  Reflections 

Think I spent approximately 8 hours on actual development and some more on setting everything up. 
I had some issues with the emulator not showing changes and crashing at random times.
Also found the documentation for the API a bit limited. 


If I would spend some more time I would have tried to add favorite functionality, refactor the code a bit
and to add some unittests.
